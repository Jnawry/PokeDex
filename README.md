# PokeDex

Created as a way to test my ablitily to use APIs. I did a lot of the work before created the repo. While doing that work I broke the code a few times(Still figuring out promises) and regretted not having a way to go back without just holding crtl + z. So here I am now hope this will be better.

# Todo list
